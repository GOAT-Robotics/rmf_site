# RMF Sandbox

The RMF Sandbox is an experimental approach to visualizing large RMF deployment sites.
It will be built in Rust using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), an open-source Rust-based game engine.
This will allow RMF Sandbox to target both desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac) and web (WebAssembly+WebGL/WebGPU) using the same codebase.
As an example, the [Traffic Editor III](https://github.com/open-rmf/traffic_editor_iii) experiment can be [https://open-rmf.github.io/traffic_editor_iii](used in a web browser) or compiled to a native executable for hardware acceleration and full performance.
